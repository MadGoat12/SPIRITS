The Piranha Plant who entered the fray in Super Smash Bros. is very special: it embodies the traits of many different sub-species of Piranha Plant, such as Poison Piranha Plants, Fire Piranha Plants, and Jumping Piranha Plants. All of these along with its unique ability to run around freely make it a terrifying force!",
